## Game <a name="Game"></a>:joystick:
### Technologies :globe_with_meridians:

- Language: [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/)
- Framework: [Eclipse]([https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.eclipse.org/)), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Library: [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io)


### How to play ? 
Players will direct the character's Anya movement in order to place bombs to killing the enemy. After the player has killed all of the monsters the game will be end.

</div>

### Game logic :bulb:

- Character: The character is controlled by the arrow key combination, only one bomb can be placed at a time.Moreover ,The character will gain speed change if the value is SpeedItem.

<br />


- Bomb :When the bomb explodes, it will create a fire trail, if the character or the enemy hits the fire trail, they will all be destroyed. The length of the flame will increase if the character eats the special items

<br />
Container class: use the CardLayout in Jpanel lib.CardLayout class manages the components in such a manner that only one component is visible at a time and it treats each component as a card .
<br />
GameManager class:
Method readMap() help the computer can read, understand the map and set the location for the items on the map  in-game

Al(t) helps the boss automatically move 
-We have to edit the checkMoveBoom() ,moveBoss() ,checkBoomToBoss() ,checkBoomToBoom(),checkDieToBoss() in the Boss, Player and BomBang class. Instead of taking input from the keyboard, you will get the object's direction from the _ai attribute via the AI() function.Here we use the isEmpty() method which checks whether a string is empty or not (all the boss die or not).This myPlayerBoom() method allows the player to place bombs at any allowed location.
<br/>
*With AI the simplest is to go random, orient classes to return random values. Specifying the return integer value corresponding to which direction is up to you to decide in function initBoss().
<br/>
*In inititIterm()we set the update power items randomly after the object can destruct base the map on the mapIterm()
<br/>
PanelGame class:
The run() in PanelGame is controlled ANYA BOMBER base on input( Up, Down,Left, Right) from the keyboard, checking the conditions for placing bombs, including: whether to receive a bomb signal from the player ( _input. space ), the time between two bombs, it also directs the win panel and the game over panel when player lose or win.The try-catch statements in run() method handles any exceptions that may occur.The "thread.sleep" is to wait 20 ms before calling move so that all the objects are completely created.

# Control buttons 🎛️:

<br/>
This class presents the menu game with three buttons(Start, Help, Exit) for players to begin the games.The initComponents()will set the size, the location and add  images of button on menu background.The initListener() is used when player click any button and it work depend on the package  java.awt.event.ActionListener
ActionListener in Java is a class that is responsible for handling all action events such as when the user clicks on a component.For buttons Start to come to panel game,Help to come to the PanelHelp , Exit to exit of the game .

# Sound Controns 🔊:

<br/>Sound class: is control by class sound which can add sounds to the game, including background sounds and the sounds of in-game events (bombs exploding, characters dying, winning, eating items, etc.). Note that the background sound and the event are independent of each other, ie playing the event sound does not affect the background sound.

<br/>
<br/>
Player( int x, int y, int orient, int timeMove): this is the constructor that is used to intialized objects such as x and y, and is called in GameManager.java for set the default position to the player character on the map. 
<br/>
getSoBoom() : the get method to return the value of the variable soBoom
setSoBoom(int soBoom) : this is the setter method called in moveItem() function to increase by one the number of booms the player has when it collects boom_item.
getSpeed(): getter method to return the value of speed of the player.
setSpeed(int speed): setter method called in moveItem() function to increase the player’s speed when collects shoe_item.
changeOrient(int newOrient): we have already set the attributes of LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN from 0 to 3 respectively. This function is called in GameManager.movePlayer(int newOrient) which is called in GamePanel.run() to set the value of orient when the user press any key ( included LEFT, RIGHT, UP ,DOWN).
<br/>
For example: If the user pressed UP key, it will be listen in the run() method on GamePanel to set the value of UP which is 2 to the newOrient variables in gameManager.movePlayer() function, then it will change the orient in Player class to newOrient and set isPlayerRun boolean into true ( the default value of it is false).
<br/>
isIrun(): this is the getter method to return the isPlayerRun boolean which is set in the changeOrient(int newOrient) method.

getRect(): to return the size of the rectangle to set the solid of the Player.<br/>
checkMoveMap(ArrayList<MapItem> arrMapItem): this function is recalled the MapIten to ArrayList to check the Player’s solid intersect the MapItem.<br/>
setMoveBoom(ArrayList<Boom> arrBoom): this function is recalled Boom.java to ArrayList to set the Boom as the solid for the Boss cannot pass through.<br/>
checkMoveBoom(ArrayList<Boom> arrBoom): this function is recalled Boom.java to ArrayList to return true or false, if the Player intersect with the Boom it will be return false that the Player cannot pass through.<br/>
move(): the function to set the position of the Player, whenever user press any key (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) it will set the x and y of the Player on the screen to make the character moving.<br/>
checkDieToBoss(ArrayList<Boss> arrBoss): this function is implemented Boss.java to ArrayList to check the collision of the Player with the Boss. If Player intersect with the Boss it will be return true and the game is over.<br/>
DatBoom(ArrayList<Boom> arrBoom): this function is implemented Boom.java to ArrayList to set the position of the Boom to be the same as the Player. <br/>
moveItem(ArrayList<Item> arrItem): this function is implemented Item.java to ArrayList, if the Player intersect with any Item, that Item will be remove by arrItem.remove(i); and Player will get extension ( such as increase speed, length boom, and number of boom).
	<br/>
	
# Boss class :bowtie:
<br/>

changeOrient(): the setter function to set the orient of the boss.
createOrient(): using random function (bound: 100) to random the orient of boss, if the random larger than 95, then the orient will random from (0 to 3) and calling the changeOrient() method.<br/>
drawBoss(Graphics2D g2d): this is the draw function which imported from java.awt.Graphics2D to display the image of the Boss on the map. 
checkMoveBoom( ArrayList<Boom> arrBoom): this function is to implement Boom.java to ArrayList to returns true or false, if the Boss intersect with the Boom it will be return false that the Boss cannot pass through.<br/>
moveBoss(ArrayList<MapItem> arrMapItem, ArrayList<Boom> arrBoom, int t): the function to set the position of the boss by increase of speed ( = 2), with the orient is setted the boss move. Calling MapItem.java and Boom.java to check the collision of the boss with the map_item and boom, if checkMoveBoss and checkMoveBossBoom equals true and false respectively, the Boss will be moving.<br/>
checkMove(ArrayList<MapItem> arrMapItem): implement the MapItem.java into ArrayList to check the intersection of the boss with the map item. If it returns false, the boss cannot move.<br/>
getRect(): the getter function to return the size of rectangle into the Boss’s solid.<br/>
